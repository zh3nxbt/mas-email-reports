# Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview

Email sync and **daily report generation system** for **MAS Precision Parts** - a precision parts manufacturing company. Syncs emails via IMAP, categorizes into threads, and generates scheduled reports:

- **4pm EST**: Full daily summary (metrics, categorized threads, PO details, action items)
- **7am EST**: Todo reminder + overnight email summary

## Critical Business Logic

### Who is MAS Precision Parts?
- **We are MAS Precision Parts** (sales@masprecisionparts.com)
- Emails FROM us are **outgoing** (we're sending to customers or vendors)
- Emails TO us are **incoming** (from customers or vendors)

### Customer vs Vendor Distinction
This is the MOST IMPORTANT classification rule:

| Scenario | Category | Item Type |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Customer sends US a PO | customer | po_received |
| WE send a PO to vendor | vendor | po_sent |
| Customer asks US for quote | customer | quote_request |
| WE ask vendor for quote | vendor | general |
| **WE send invoice to customer** | **customer** | general |
| **WE send quotation/quote/estimate** | **customer** | general |
| Thread starts with [RECEIVED] | customer | (they initiated) |
| Thread starts with [SENT] PO/RFQ | vendor | (we're buying) |

**Key rules:**
- When WE send an **invoice, quotation, quote, or estimate** → it's a **CUSTOMER** interaction (we're billing/quoting them)
- When WE send a **PO or RFQ** → it's a **VENDOR** interaction (we're buying from them)
- The simple "first email direction = category" rule has exceptions for invoices/quotes!

### Action Items (Todos)
Todos are identified when:
1. **po_unacknowledged**: Customer sent PO, we haven't replied
2. **quote_unanswered**: Customer requested quote, we haven't replied
3. **general_unanswered**: Customer email, last message is from them

**Important:** AI also checks `needsResponse` - if the last email is "thanks", "sounds good", or similar acknowledgment, no todo is created even if the last email is from the customer.

### Acknowledgment Detection

The system detects simple acknowledgment emails that don't need a response:
- "Thanks!", "Thank you!", "Great thanks!"
- "Got it!", "Sounds good!", "Perfect!"
- "Received!", "Noted!", "Will do!"

**Key edge cases handled:**
1. **Signature images ≠ real attachments**: Emails often have signature images that appear as "attachments". These are detected by:
   - Small file size (<100KB)
   - Image content types (PNG, JPEG, GIF)
   - Real attachments are PDFs, documents, large files
2. **"Thank you and kind regards" ≠ acknowledgment**: Polite closings with attachments (like a PO) are NOT acknowledgments
3. **Customer "thanks" after our reply**: If customer says "Great thanks!" after we acknowledge their PO, the todo is RESOLVED (we replied)

### PO Detection Fallback

If AI misclassifies a PO as "general", the system detects POs from subject patterns:
- "PO number", "PO attached", "PO#"
- "Purchase order"
- Patterns like "PO 12345", "PO00221"

### Todo Resolution Logic

A todo is resolved in two ways:

**1. Automatic Resolution (email activity):**
- When **we send ANY email** in that thread during the time window
- Customer sends PO → We acknowledge → Customer says "Thanks!" → **TODO IS RESOLVED** (we replied)

**2. Manual Dismissal (user clicks "Mark Complete"):**
- Adds threadKey to `dismissed_threads` table (persists across report regeneration)
- Future reports will NOT recreate todos for dismissed threadKeys
- Can be un-dismissed via `DELETE /api/dismissed-threads` with `{ threadKey }`

**Why two mechanisms?**
- Auto-resolution is based on email activity in current report window
- Manual dismissal is permanent until explicitly un-dismissed
- This prevents manually resolved todos from reappearing when customers send follow-up emails

### UI Labels
- **Todo labels**: "Need to Ack PO", "Need to Send Quote", "Need to Reply"
- **Thread labels**: "PO Received", "PO Sent", "RFQ", "General"
- **Sort order**: PO Received/Sent → RFQ → General → Other

## Technical Learnings

### Email Fetching (IMAP)

**DO:**
```typescript
// Use mailparser for proper MIME decoding
import { simpleParser } from "mailparser";
const msg = await client.fetchOne(uid, { source: true }, { uid: true });
const parsed = await simpleParser(msg.source);
// parsed.text is already decoded (base64, quoted-printable, charset)
```

**DON'T:**
```typescript
// DON'T use download() - it hangs
const { content } = await client.download(uid, part); // HANGS!

// DON'T nest fetchOne inside fetch iterator - causes IMAP command conflicts
for await (const msg of client.fetch(uids, {...})) {
  await client.fetchOne(msg.uid, {...}); // HANGS!
}
```

**Correct pattern:** Collect UIDs first, then fetch individually:
```typescript
const uidsToSync = [...]; // Get list first
for (const uid of uidsToSync) {
  const msg = await client.fetchOne(uid, { source: true }, { uid: true });
}
```

### IMAP Mailbox Names

MAS server uses Dovecot with `INBOX.` prefix and `.` separator:
- **INBOX** - main inbox
- **INBOX.Sent** (aliased as "Sent") - primary sent folder
- **INBOX.Sent Messages** (aliased as "Sent Messages") - secondary sent folder

**Important:** Both "Sent" and "Sent Messages" folders contain sent emails. The syncer fetches from both.

### IMAP SINCE Search Limitation

IMAP `SINCE` search is **date-only** (ignores time). To filter by datetime:
```typescript
// IMAP search returns all emails from the date onwards
const searchResult = await client.search({ since: sinceDate }, { uid: true });

// Post-filter in database if precise datetime cutoff needed
await db.delete(schema.emails).where(lt(schema.emails.date, cutoffDate));
```

### Timezone Handling

**Always use explicit timezone for EST display:**
```typescript
// CORRECT - explicit timezone
date.toLocaleDateString("en-US", {
  timeZone: "America/New_York",
  weekday: "short",
  month: "short",
  day: "numeric",
});

// WRONG - uses system timezone
date.toLocaleDateString("en-US", { ... });
```

### CLI Date Argument Parsing

When passing dates via CLI, include time to avoid timezone shift:
```bash
# CORRECT - explicit time prevents UTC midnight issues
npm run report -- --date=2026-01-26T12:00:00

# WRONG - 2026-01-26 becomes Jan 25 in EST due to UTC midnight
npm run report -- --date=2026-01-26
```

### Process Management

Always add `process.exit(0)` at end of CLI scripts - database connection keeps Node process alive.

### References Field

`parsed.references` from mailparser can be string OR array:
```typescript
references: Array.isArray(parsed.references)
  ? parsed.references.join(" ")
  : parsed.references || null
```

### Next.js Hydration Warnings

Browser extensions can cause hydration mismatch warnings. Add `suppressHydrationWarning` to html/body:
```tsx
<html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
  <body suppressHydrationWarning>
```

### SMTP Email Sending

**Self-signed certificates:** Some SMTP servers use self-signed TLS certificates. Handle with:
```typescript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
  port: parseInt(process.env.SMTP_PORT || "587"),
  secure: false,
  auth: { user: process.env.SMTP_USER, pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS },
  tls: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false, // Allow self-signed certs
  },
});
```

**Email syncing before report:** The `npm run report` command automatically syncs emails before generating. This ensures the report has the latest data.

### Email Template Styling

**Use inline styles for colors!** Email clients often strip `<style>` tags and CSS classes. Always use inline styles:
```typescript
// WRONG - CSS classes may be stripped
<div class="thread-label po">PO Received</div>

// CORRECT - inline styles work everywhere
<div style="color: #059669;">PO Received</div>
```

**Label colors:**
- PO Received: green (#059669)
- PO Sent: purple (#7c3aed)
- RFQ: blue (#2563eb)
- General: gray (#6b7280)
- Need to Ack PO: red (#dc2626)
- Need to Send Quote / Need to Reply: orange (#d97706)

### AI Classification

Thread categorization uses **Sonnet only** for reliable business email classification:
- Simplified business-context prompt (~40 lines vs 100+ previously)
- Body truncation: 800 chars in batch mode, 1500 for single
- Up to 20 threads per API call, falls back to individual calls if batch fails
- See `src/report/summarizer.ts` → `categorizeThreadsBatch()`

AI returns additional fields for each thread:
- **needsResponse**: `false` if last email is "thanks", "sounds good", etc.
- **relatedTo**: threadKey if this thread responds to another (e.g., vendor quote responding to our RFQ)

Post-AI processing uses only **definitional constraints** (not pattern heuristics):
- `po_received` → must be `customer` (they sent us PO)
- `po_sent` → must be `vendor` (we sent them PO)
- `quote_request` from us → must be `vendor` (we're buying)

### Thread Grouping

Threads are grouped using three passes (`src/sync/threader.ts`):
1. **Message-ID/References**: Standard email threading
2. **In-Reply-To**: Fallback for broken references
3. **Subject-based**: Merges threads with same normalized subject (handles "RE: PO 1049" + "PO 1049")

Additionally, AI-detected `relatedTo` relationships merge threads that are semantically related but have different subjects (e.g., "RFQ Plates" → "Estimate 28522 from Valk's Machinery").

### Web UI Report Generation

The dashboard has a "Generate Report" button that:
- Syncs emails first
- Determines report type based on current EST time:
  - 7am-4pm → generates `daily_summary` (4pm report)
  - 4pm-7am → generates `morning_reminder` (7am report)
- Replaces existing report for same date/type
- API endpoint: `POST /api/generate-report`

## Database Schema

- **email_messages**: Raw synced emails
- **daily_reports**: Generated reports with metrics and HTML
- **report_threads**: Categorized thread summaries per report
- **todo_items**: Action items identified in reports
- **dismissed_threads**: Manually dismissed threadKeys (persists across report regeneration)

## Scheduling

Use Windows Task Scheduler or cron:
- `npm run report` at 4pm EST daily
- `npm run report:morning` at 7am EST daily

## Git / SSH

This repo uses SSH with a custom host alias. The remote is configured as:
```
git@github-zh3n:zh3nxbt/email-fetcher.git
```

This uses the `github-zh3n` alias defined in `~/.ssh/config`:
```
Host github-zh3n
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github_zh3n
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

**Important:** Use `github-zh3n` instead of `github.com` in the remote URL to use the correct SSH key.
